# Christmas-Catalogue-Website
This is a website created in HTML, CSS, PHP and Javascript for a university project to create an online product catalogue.

<br><br>
This project is similar to Ebay and Amazon and incorporates a chirstmas theme to display a list of christmas products for the user to purchase. This is done asynchronously with AJAX as well as through a currency converter where the user can input a number to convert from a choice of five currencies and their value is updated in real time.
<br><br>
Also included is a slideshow, an automatically playing classical song and an embed of a spotify christmas playlist.
<br><br>
Finally this has PHP to save a user state upon revisiting the website through a counter that counts the amount of times a user has visited the site, as well as login states. This is further elaborated by a user having a login parameter for whether they are an admin or not. If they are, then they have the ability to add and edit products but if they are not then they can just view the products.
<br><br>
<h3>The login details are as follows</h3>
Username - "admin"<br>Password - "admin"<br><h4>Has administrator capabilities</h4><br><br>
Username - "notadmin"<br>Password - "notadmin"<br><h4>Does not have administrator capabilities</h4><br><br>
Username - "Ryan"<br>Password - "Ryan"<br><h4>Has administrator capabilities</h4>
<br><br>
Working on this project was a breeze and has really seemed to spur a love for web development for me, I've learnt new techniques such as PHP includes which has saved valuable time and increased efficiency, PHP loops as well as AJAX and asynchronous Javascript.
<br><br>
However this project was completed last year and I beleive I had now learnt better and more professional techniques such as seperate folders for specific files as a sperate folder for the login system and another for the product system as opposed to all the files being held together in one folder.
